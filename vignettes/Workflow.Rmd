Our goal is to describe the use of Bioconductor software to perform some
basic tasks in the analysis of ChIP-Seq data. We will use several
functions in the as-yet-unreleased `r Biocpkg("chipseq")` package, which
provides convenient interfaces to other powerful packages such as
`r Biocpkg("ShortRead")` and `r Biocpkg("IRanges")`. We will also use
the `r CRANpkg("lattice")` and `r Biocpkg("rtracklayer")` packages for
visualization.

```{r setup, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(chipseq) 
library(GenomicFeatures) 
library(lattice)
```

# Example data 

The `cstest` data set is included in the `r Biocpkg("chipseq")` package
to help demonstrate its capabilities. The dataset contains data for
three chromosomes from Solexa lanes, one from a CTCF mouse ChIP-Seq, and
one from a GFP mouse ChIP-Seq. The raw reads were aligned to the
reference genome (mouse in this case) using an external program (MAQ),
and the results read in using the the `readAligned` function in the
`r Biocpkg("ShortRead")`, in conjunction with a filter produced by the
`chipseqFilter` function. This step filtered the reads to remove
duplicates, to restrict mappings to the canonical, autosomal chromosomes
and ensure that only a single read maps to a given position. A quality
score cutoff was also applied. The remaining data were reduced to a set
of aligned intervals (including orientation). This saves a great deal of
memory, as the sequences, which are unnecessary, are discarded. Finally,
we subset the data for chr10 to chr12, simply for convenience in this
vignette.

We outline this process with this unevaluated code block:

```{r preprocess, eval=FALSE}
qa_list <- lapply(sampleFiles, qa)
report(do.call(rbind, qa_list)) 
## spend some time evaluating the QA report, then procede 
filter <- compose(chipseqFilter(), alignQualityFilter(15)) 
cstest <- GenomicRangesList(lapply(sampleFiles, function(file) {
  as(readAligned(file, filter), "GRanges") 
}))
cstest <- cstest[seqnames(cstest) %in% c("chr10", "chr11", "chr12")]
```

The above step has been performed in advance, and
the output has been included as a dataset in this package. We load
it now: 

```{r} 
data(cstest)
cstest 
```

```{r convert-cstest, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
## code used to convert the GenomeDataList to a GRangesList
cstest <- GenomicRangesList(lapply(cstest, function(gd)
  do.call(c, lapply(names(gd), function(chr) 
    pos <- gd[[chr]] 
    starts <- c( pos[["-"]] - 23L, pos[["+"]]) 
    GRanges(chr, IRanges(starts, width = 24), 
           rep(c("-", "+"), elementNROWS(pos))) ))
)) 
```

`cstest` is an object of class *GRangesList*, and has a list-like
structure, each component representing the alignments from one lane, as
a *GRanges* object of stranded intervals. 

```{r}
cstest$ctcf
```

# Extending reads

Solexa gives us the first few (24 in this example) bases of each
fragment it sequences, but the actual fragment is longer.  By design,
the sites of interest (transcription factor binding sites) should be
somewhere in the fragment, but not necessarily in its initial part.
Although the actual lengths of fragments vary, extending the alignment
of the short read by a fixed amount in the appropriate direction,
depending on whether the alignment was to the positive or negative
strand, makes it more likely that we cover the actual site of
interest.


It is possible to estimate the fragment length, through a variety of
methods. There are several implemented by the
`estimate.mean.fraglen` function. Generally, this only needs
to be done for one sample from each experimental protocol. Here, we
use SSISR, the default method: 

```{r estimate.mean.fraglen}
fraglen <- estimate.mean.fraglen(cstest$ctcf, method="correlation")
fraglen[!is.na(fraglen)] 
```

Given the suggestion of $~190$ nucleotides,
we extend all reads to be 200 bases long. This is done using the
`resize` function, which considers the strand to determine the direction
of extension: 

```{r}
ctcf.ext <- resize (cstest$ctcf, width = 200)
ctcf.ext
```


We now have intervals for the CTCF lane that represent the original
fragments that were precipitated.

# Coverage, islands, and depth

A useful summary of this information is the
*coverage*, that is, how many times each base in the genome was
covered by one of these intervals.

```{r}
cov.ctcf <- coverage(ctcf.ext)
cov.ctcf
```

For efficiency, the result is stored in a run-length encoded form.

The regions of interest are contiguous segments of non-zero coverage,
also known as *islands*.

```{r}
islands <- slice(cov.ctcf, lower = 1)
islands
```

For each island, we can compute the number of reads in the island, and
the maximum coverage depth within that island.

```{r}
viewSums(islands)
viewMaxs(islands)

nread.tab <- table(viewSums(islands) / 200)
depth.tab <- table(viewMaxs(islands))

nread.tab[,1:10]
depth.tab[,1:10]
```

# Processing multiple lanes

Although data from one lane is often a natural analytical unit, we
typically want to apply any procedure to all lanes. 
Here is a simple summary function that
computes the frequency distribution of the number of reads.

```{r}
islandReadSummary <- function(x)
{
    g <- resize(x, 200)
    s <- slice(coverage(g), lower = 1)
    tab <- table(viewSums(s) / 200)
    df <- DataFrame(tab)
    colnames(df) <- c("chromosome", "nread", "count")
    df$nread <- as.integer(df$nread)
    df
}
```

Applying it to our test-case, we get

```{r}
head(islandReadSummary(cstest$ctcf)) 
``` 

We can now use it to summarize
the full dataset, flattening the returned *DataFrameList* with the
`stack` function. 

```{r} 
nread.islands <- DataFrameList(lapply(cstest, islandReadSummary)) 
nread.islands <- stack(nread.islands, "sample") 
nread.islands 
```

```{r fig.height=10}
xyplot(log(count) ~  nread | sample, as.data.frame(nread.islands),
       subset = (chromosome == "chr10" & nread <= 40), 
       layout = c(1, 2), pch = 16, type = c("p", "g"))
```

If reads were sampled randomly from the genome, then the null
distribution number of reads per island would have a geometric
distribution; that is, 
$$P(X = k) = p^{k-1} (1-p)$$ 
In other words, $\log P(X = k)$ is linear in $k$. Although our 
samples are not random, the islands with just one or two reads may be 
representative of the null distribution. 

```{r fig.height=8}
xyplot(log(count) ~ nread | sample, data = as.data.frame(nread.islands), 
       subset = (chromosome == "chr10" & nread <= 40), 
       layout = c(1, 2), pch = 16, type = c("p", "g"), 
       panel = function(x, y, ...) {
           panel.lmline(x[1:2], y[1:2], col = "black")
           panel.xyplot(x, y, ...)
       })
```

We can create a similar plot of the distribution of depths. 

```{r}
islandDepthSummary <- function(x) 
{
  g <- resize(x, 200) 
  s <- slice(coverage(g), lower = 1) 
  tab <- table(viewMaxs(s) / 200) 
  df <- DataFrame(tab) 
  colnames(df) <- c("chromosome", "depth", "count")
  df$depth <- as.integer(df$depth) 
  df
} 

depth.islands <- DataFrameList(lapply(cstest, islandDepthSummary))
depth.islands <- stack(depth.islands, "sample")

plt <- xyplot(log(count) ~ depth | sample, as.data.frame(depth.islands),
       subset = (chromosome == "chr10" & depth <= 20), 
       layout = c(1, 2), pch = 16, type = c("p", "g"), 
       panel = function(x, y, ...){
           lambda <- 2 * exp(y[2]) / exp(y[1]) 
           null.est <- function(xx) {
               xx * log(lambda) - lambda - lgamma(xx + 1)
           } 
           log.N.hat <- null.est(1) - y[1]
           panel.lines(1:10, -log.N.hat + null.est(1:10), col = "black")
           panel.xyplot(x, y, ...)
       })

## depth.islands <- summarizeReads(cstest, summary.fun = islandDepthSummary)
```

```{r fig.height=10, echo=FALSE}
plt
```

The above plot is very useful for detecting peaks, discussed in the next
section. As a convenience, it can be created for the coverage over all
chromosomes for a single sample by calling the `islandDepthPlot`
function: 

```{r islandDepthPlot, eval=FALSE}
islandDepthPlot(cov.ctcf)
```

# Peaks

To obtain a set of putative binding sites, i.e., peaks, we need to find
those regions that are significantly above the noise level. Using the
same Poisson-based approach for estimating the noise distribution as in
the plot above, the `peakCutoff` function returns a cutoff value for a
specific FDR: 

```{r peakCutoff}
peakCutoff(cov.ctcf, fdr = 0.0001) 
```

Considering the above calculation of $7$ at an FDR of $0.0001$, and
looking at the above plot, we might choose $8$ as a conservative peak
cutoff: 

```{r} 
peaks.ctcf <- slice(cov.ctcf, lower = 8) 
peaks.ctcf 
```

To summarize the peaks for exploratory analysis, we call the
`peakSummary` function: 

```{r peakSummary}
peaks <- peakSummary(peaks.ctcf) 
``` 

The result is a *GRanges* object with two
columns: the view maxs and the view sums. Beyond that, this object is
often useful as a scaffold for adding additional statistics.

It is meaningful to ask about the contribution of each strand to each
peak, as the sequenced region of pull-down fragments would be on
opposite sides of a binding site depending on which strand it matched.
We can compute strand-specific coverage, and look at the individual
coverages under the combined peaks as follows: 

```{r} 
peak.depths <- viewMaxs(peaks.ctcf)

cov.pos <- coverage(ctcf.ext[strand(ctcf.ext) == "+"]) 
cov.neg <- coverage(ctcf.ext[strand(ctcf.ext) == "-"])

peaks.pos <- Views(cov.pos, ranges(peaks.ctcf)) 
peaks.neg <- Views(cov.neg, ranges(peaks.ctcf))

wpeaks <- tail(order(peak.depths$chr10), 4)
wpeaks
```

Below, we plot the four highest peaks on chromosome 10.

```{r fig.height=5}
coverageplot(peaks.pos$chr10[wpeaks[1]], peaks.neg$chr10[wpeaks[1]])
```

```{r fig.height=5}
coverageplot(peaks.pos$chr10[wpeaks[2]], peaks.neg$chr10[wpeaks[2]])
```

```{r fig.height=5}
coverageplot(peaks.pos$chr10[wpeaks[3]], peaks.neg$chr10[wpeaks[3]])
``` 

```{r fig.height=5}
coverageplot(peaks.pos$chr10[wpeaks[4]], peaks.neg$chr10[wpeaks[4]])
```

# Differential peaks

One common question is: which peaks are different in two samples?  One
simple strategy is the following: combine the two peak sets, and
compare the two samples by calculating summary statistics for
the combined peaks on top of each coverage vector.

```{r}
## find peaks for GFP control
cov.gfp <- coverage(resize(cstest$gfp, 200))
peaks.gfp <- slice(cov.gfp, lower = 8)

peakSummary <- diffPeakSummary(peaks.gfp, peaks.ctcf)

plt <- xyplot(asinh(sums2) ~ asinh(sums1) | seqnames,
       data = as.data.frame(peakSummary), 
       panel = function(x, y, ...) {
           panel.xyplot(x, y, ...)
           panel.abline(median(y - x), 1)
       },
       type = c("p", "g"), alpha = 0.5, aspect = "iso")
``` 

```{r fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
plt
```

We use a simple cutoff to flag peaks that are different. 

```{r}
mcols(peakSummary) <- 
    within(mcols(peakSummary), 
       {
           diffs <- asinh(sums2) - asinh(sums1) 
           resids <- (diffs - median(diffs)) / mad(diffs) 
           up <- resids > 2 
           down <- resids < -2 
           change <- ifelse(up, "up", ifelse(down, "down", "flat")) 
       })
```

# Placing peaks in genomic context 

Locations of individual peaks may be of interest. Alternatively, a
global summary might look at classifying the peaks of interest in the
context of genomic features such as promoters, upstream regions, etc.
The `r Biocpkg("GenomicFeatures")` package facilitates obtaining gene
annotations from different data sources. We could download the UCSC gene
predictions for the mouse genome and generate a *GRanges* object with
the transcript regions (from the first to last exon, contiguous) using
`makeTxDbFromUCSC`; here we use a library containing a recent snapshot.

```{r}
library(TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm9.knownGene) 
gregions <- transcripts(TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm9.knownGene) 
gregions 
```

We can now estimate the promoter for each transcript: 

```{r}
promoters <- flank(gregions, 1000, both = TRUE) 
```

And count the peaks
that fall into a promoter:

```{r}
peakSummary$inPromoter <- peakSummary %over% promoters
xtabs(~ inPromoter + change, peakSummary) 
```

or somewhere upstream or in a gene:

```{r}
peakSummary$inUpstream <- peakSummary %over% flank(gregions, 20000)
peakSummary$inGene <- peakSummary %over% gregions
```

```{r}
sumtab <- 
    as.data.frame(rbind(total = xtabs(~ change, peakSummary),
                        promoter = xtabs(~ change, 
                          subset(peakSummary, inPromoter)),
                        upstream = xtabs(~ change, 
                          subset(peakSummary, inUpstream)),
                        gene = xtabs(~ change, subset(peakSummary, inGene))))
## cbind(sumtab, ratio = round(sumtab[, "down"] /  sumtab[, "up"], 3))
```

# Visualizing peaks in genomic context

While it is generally informative to calculate statistics incorporating
the genomic context, eventually one wants a picture. The traditional
genome browser view is an effective method of visually integrating
multiple annotations with experimental data along the genome.

Using the `r Biocpkg("rtracklayer")` package, we can upload our coverage
and peaks for both samples to the UCSC Genome Browser:

```{r rtracklayer-upload, eval=FALSE}
library(rtracklayer) 
session <- browserSession() 
genome(session) <- "mm9" 
session$gfpCov <- cov.gfp
session$gfpPeaks <- peaks.gfp 
session$ctcfCov <- cov.ctcf
session$ctcfPeaks <- peaks.ctcf 
``` 

Once the tracks are uploaded, we can
choose a region to view, such as the tallest peak on chr10 in the CTCF
data: 

```{r rtracklayer-view, eval=FALSE}  
peak.ord <- order(unlist(peak.depths), decreasing=TRUE) 
peak.sort <- as(peaks.ctcf, "GRanges")[peak.ord] 
view <- browserView(session, peak.sort[1], full = c("gfpCov", "ctcfCov")) 
```

We coerce to *GRanges* so that we
can sort the ranges across chromosomes. By passing the `full` parameter
to `browserView` we instruct UCSC to display the coverage tracks as a
bar chart. Next, we might programmatically display a view for the top 5
tallest peaks: 

```{r tracklayer-view-5, eval=FALSE} 
views <- browserView(session, head(peak.sort, 5), full = c("gfpCov", "ctcfCov")) 
```

# Version information 

```{r} 
sessionInfo() 
```
